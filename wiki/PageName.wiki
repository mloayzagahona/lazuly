#summary MinuteProject show case on lazuly conference db

= Introduction =

MinuteProject presents a set of reverse-engineering capabilities based on the Lazuly conference db.

Lazuly conference db in version 0.1 contains 13 tables, 2 views.

The following 'smart' reverse-engineering solutions will be demonstrated for:
 * jpa2 
 * openxava
 * vaadin
 * playframework
 * grails

= Details =

Lazuly database holds information related to conference information such as conference_member, speaker, sponsors, speech_evalutions ...
The goal is to have a working business model that illustrate some complexity and show how by enriching with the minimun set of info, there is the possibility to have comprehensive reverse-engineering solutions that spans over different applications artifacts and are not limited to creating Domain Object in an single directory.
