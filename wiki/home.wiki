= Introduction =

MinuteProject presents a set of reverse-engineering capabilities based on the Lazuly conference db.

Lazuly conference db in version 0.1 contains 13 tables, 2 views.

The following 'smart' reverse-engineering solutions will be demonstrated for:
 * jpa2 
 * openxava
 * vaadin
 * playframework
 * grails

= Details =

Lazuly database holds information related to conference information such as conference_member, speaker, sponsors, speech_evalutions ...

The goal is to have a working business model that illustrate some complexity and show how by enriching with the minimun set of info, there is the possibility to have comprehensive reverse-engineering solutions that spans over different applications artifacts and are not limited to creating Domain Object in an single directory.

The user will learn how to use minuteproject to:
 * package the entities into logical business bundles
 * enrich with a primary key strategy
 * create enums for specific fields
 * add conventions that affects all model entities
 * enrich views to add them a primary key and foreign keys
